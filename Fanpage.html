        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>My Chemical Romance (often abbreviated as <strong>MCR</strong> or shortened to <strong>My Chem</strong>) is an American rock band from Newark, New Jersey. My Chemical Romance released their first album, <em>I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love</em>, in 2002 and the band continued to release bangers until, to the dismay of fans world-wide, they announced their break up on March 22, 2013. In 2016 they released a tenth anniversary edition of their third album, <em>The Black Parade</em>. This release sparked hope of a possible reunion but nothing was ever mentioned until finally, six years after their break up they announced on October 31, 2019 they announced they would be performing a reunion show! YAY! The reunion show was announced as a single show and was performed in Los Angeles, California on December 20, 2019. Approximately a week later they announced an entire reunion tour with 30 shows throughout 2020. </p>
